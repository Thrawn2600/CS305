Artemis Financial is a consulting company that creates custom financial plans for their customers. They offer savings, retirement, investment and insurance products. In an effort to modernize their business they have contracted us to review the security of their software. Specifically, I have uploaded my vulnerability assessment. 

I feel as though my strengths in executing on this request was my thoroughness. I very carefully examined the codebase and conducted quite a bit of research. It is important to have secure code to protect the privacy of clients as well as deliver high quality financial products. This can not be accomplished if malicious actors can take advantage of poorly secured code to manipulate it to their own ends. It could lead to anything from data breeches to lost funds. 

One of the big challenges was learning a lot of new terminology quickly, and learning a new framework quickly. The timelines of this class was short, so becoming familiar with so much new information in the codebase proved to be a challenge. 

Defense in depth is a term I picked up in this course. The idea behind a secure program is to have layers of security. I created this depth by reviewing the code itself for logical errors, validating user input, encrypting data and using secure methods of communication. 

I used Maven to run dependency check reports to find known vulnerabilities in the code and attached libraries. If I wanted to know if I had added additional vulnerabilities, I could suppress all the old warnings and then run a check again to see just the new ones. 

I think the dependency check report will be something that I find useful in the future. Especially moving towards industry, I need to be conscious of security while creating software that will be exposed to the public. 

While I am proud of the work I have done in this class, I do not think I will be moving in a direction that includes DevSecOps. I like the more creative side of coding. I would like to work with DevSecOps and would be happy to incorporate concepts or receive directions from my team members but I struggled in some areas in this course.  I could show this to an employer as an example of something that I accomplished when I didn't feel the most confident. It would be a good example of perseverance in the face of adversity.
